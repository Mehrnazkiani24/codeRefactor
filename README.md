# codeRefactor

As a developer I would like to update the code on the page without affedting the images and the format. 

This project was to look at the backend codes and clean up the design as without changing the images on the front end as well as remove the reperative contents. 

the problem resolved the multiple steps which was included in the set up, include the detials of the search engienes and the sections they are located under. 

Learned how VS and CSS work hand in had to build and maintain a site or vice versa. 

body and header was updated to breakdown the details of each category.
